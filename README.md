My motto "makes people and machines happy". This motto stolen from a very kind familier person of mine. It is a pity we have not spoken 10 years ago. 
Try to make people happy since I born with more or less success. Try to make machines happy a month ago. Will see how will it goes.
I am an economist with 22 years of work experience now. I am in a career change currently. I would like to be a Python programmer.
